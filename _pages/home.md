The Orthopaedic Mechatronics (orthotron) Laboratory in the Mechanical & Mechatronics Dept. at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/) is focused on a multidisciplinary approach to develop and evaluate orthopaedic interventions, ranging from robotic manipulators to characterize bone-implant mechanics to wearable sensors for musculoskeletal rehabilitation monitoring.
